## Introvert for Craft CMS

### Overview

Introvert allows you to see reverse related entries to the entry currently being edited.

The fieldtype is super handy for seeing which assets are being used by which entries:

Options for each field's instance allow you to restrict relationship lookups to specific sections.

2. Install and activate the Introvert Plugin
