## Introvert Fieldtype for Craft CMS

### Overview

Introvert allows you to see reverse related entries to the entry currently being edited.

The fieldtype is super handy for seeing which assets are being used by which entries. Simply add a Reverse Related Entries field on your Asset source Field Layout:

Options for each field's instance allow you to restrict relationship lookups to specific sections.
